Globus is a non-profit service for secure, reliable **research data management** developed and operated by the **University of Chicago** and **Argonne National Laboratory**, supported by funding from the Department of Energy, NSF, and the NIH. With Globus, subscribers can **move, share, & discover data** via a single interface â€“ whether your files live on a supercomputer, lab cluster, tape archive, public cloud or your laptop, you can manage this data from anywhere, using your existing identities, via just a web browser.

Globus started as a pure transfer tool with two strengths:

1. Fast transfers over good networks
2. Robust transfers over flaky networks

Globus now has the add functionality of:

- Data sharing and flexible access control
- Identity management
- A web GUI, scriptable command line tool, and powerful API
