MATLAB is an integrated technical computing environment from the MathWorks that combines array-based numeric computation, advanced graphics and visualization, and a high-level programming language. Separately licensed toolboxes provide additional domain-specific functionality.

The topics of this workshop include:

  - Running optimization problems in MATLAB
  - Specifying objective functions
  - Specifying constraints
  - Choosing solvers and algorithms
  - Evaluating results and improving performance
  - Using global optimization methods
  - Using parallel computing to speed up optimizations
