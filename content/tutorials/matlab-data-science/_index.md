The hands-on courses in this workshop cover the use of Matlab for data science applications.
They cover the areas of machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics.

Highlights of machine learning modules include:

 - Finding Natural Patterns in Data
 - Classification Methods
 - Improving Predictive Models
 - Regression Methods
 - Neural Networks

Highlights of deep learning modules include:

 - Classifying Images with Convolutional Networks
 - Interpreting Network Behavior
 - Creating Networks
 - Training Networks
 - Improving Performance
 - Performing Regression
 - Using Deep Learning for Computer Vision
 - Classifying Sequence Data with Recurrent Networks

 A video of using Matlab for data analytics is also included.

The first 3 links below are to the MathWorks resource page on data science. At the bottom of the main resource page are links to short videos, including the data science tutorial shown in the second link below. The 4 links following the data science examples link are to the MathWork's Matlab Academy online courses in data science. The two 'onramp' links are introductions to machine learning and deep learning using Matlab. The next two links are in-depth courses in machine learning and deep learning using Matlab. Next to each section is an estimate of the amount of time it would take to go through the material in the corresponding link. The last link is to a video of using Matlab for data analytics.
