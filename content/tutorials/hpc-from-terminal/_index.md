This tutorial is an introduction to the command-line interface of high-performance computing systems. Weâ€™ll learn how to use commands to perform basic operations in the terminal: creating and navigating directories, listing and displaying files, moving and copying files. We will also cover creating files, searching files, and managing file permissions. Working in the command line, we can combine existing programs and utilities, automate repetitive tasks, and connect to remote resources.
