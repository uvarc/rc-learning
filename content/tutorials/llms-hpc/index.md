Landing Page Template Instructions: 
* The Landing Page connects users to your notes page and to download code if needed
* This is the Landing Page template (i.e the page corresponding to learning.rc.virginia.edu/tutorials/your-tutorial-name)
    * Create a new folder in tutorials with the naming convention of topic-subtopic (e.x hpc-intro or deep-learning-hpc) - this will also be the url like mentioned in the previous bullet point
    * add one file to it `index.md` (or copy over this file and rename it accordingly)
* Please read through instructions before using

The Landing Page consists of 2 sections.
1. front matter (surrounded by --- and located at the top of index.md)
2. content (optional) - provides the user with additional information prior to them checking out the notes page

1. Front matter example:
---
title: Introduction to UVA HPC
summary: "This tutorial is an introduction to using UVA's high-performance computing (HPC) system."
date: "2021-04-13T00:00:00" # Schedule page publish date (NOT talk date).
authors: [jmh,kah,pbo] # content/authors has the following authors: as, cag, gka, jmh, kah, khs, pbo, rs, teh, uvarc, wtr
categories: ["HPC"] # choose from current categories/tags* or create your own if needed
tags: ["HPC"] # choose from current categories/tags* or create your own if needed

notes: hpc-intro # 
url_code: notes/hpc-intro/code/hpc_intro.zip (optional - can add if there is code that corresponds to your tutorial)
---

* categories/tags available: 
Bioinformatics, C++, C/C++, Compilers, Containers, Data Analytics, Data Transfer, Docker, Fiji, Fortran, Globus, HPC, Image Processing, Image_Processing, MATLAB, MPI, OpenMP, Parallel Computing, Parallel Programming, Git, Slurm, Unix

    1a. Explanation of the front matter fields
    title: Big Blue Title Link that appears on main tutorials page + title of landing page
    summary: text underneath the title link that appears on main tutorials page (learning.rc.virginia.edu/tutorials)
    date: date of publishing tutorial
    authors: populates author links that correspond to the author in people tab
    categories: populates links that the user can find relating tutorials with the same category
    tags: corresponds to the filters on the main tutorial page

    notes: Notes button - links the landing page to the notes of your tutorial (should be the same as the folder created in notes)
    url_code: Code button - downloads a file that may be in your notes folder

2. (Optional) Content Example: You can use this page to introduce your topic or direct users to download code

Deep Learning (DL) is a powerful tool transforming scientific workflow. Because DL training is computationally intensive, it is well suited to HPC systems. Effective use of UVA HPC resources can greatly accelerate your DL workflows. In this tutorial, we will discuss:

When is it appropriate to use a GPU?
How to optimize single-GPU code?
How to convert single-GPU code to Multi-GPU code in different frameworks and run it on UVA HPC?
Please download and unzip the code above to follow along with the activities.

TODO: 
- create folder in tutorials named your-tutorial-name using the naming conventions mentioned anove
- create index.md in that folder and paste in the non-comment portions below
- fill in the fields for the front matter and content accordingly
