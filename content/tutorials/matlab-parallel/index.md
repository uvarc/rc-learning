By working through common scenarios and workflows, you will gain an understanding of the parallel constructs in MATLAB, their capabilities, and some of the typical issues that arise when using them.

The examples in this workshop will vary in difficulty, starting from simple parallel usage concepts and progressing to more advanced techniques.  Attendees will be able to ask questions and receive feedback regarding workshop exercises.  Users will also have the opportunity to run MATLAB code on the Rivanna cluster if they have login accounts.

Highlights include:

 - Speeding up programs with parallel computing
 - Offloading computations and cluster computing
 - Working with large data sets
 - GPU Computing

Requirements:
MATLAB experience or basic programming or coding experience is suggested.  Cluster computing and Linux experience is not required for this workshop.

 1.     Download the `code` zip file above
 2.     Unzip the folder to a known location
 3.     Navigate to the folder location from within MATLAB
 4.     Run startWorkshop.m

## Parallel Computing Workshop Exercises
Unzip the file you downloaded and work from that folder.
