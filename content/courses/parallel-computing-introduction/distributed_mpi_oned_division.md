In the most common cases, we want a full exchange of data between every two communicating processes.  If we examine our schematic again

we will observe that we can think of the blue arrows as a sweep from _left_ to _right_, while the orange arrows represent a return sweep from _right_ to _left_. This pattern is particularly common when we are computing on a distributed domain and must exchange information among the subdomains.

## Domain Decomposition

We have discussed [domain decomposition](/courses/parallel-computing-introduction/distributed_mpi_domain_decomp) in a general case.  Let us now consider a more specific example.  We wish to do some computations on a _grid_. A grid divides some region into smaller segments often called _zones_. We will convert our problem from some kind of continuous equations into a _discretized_ system that will be solved on the grid.

The illustration shows a small 10x16 grid that we will divide into subgrids, one for each rank. To keep our first example simple, we will do a one-dimensional decomposition in which we will split the grid into strips.
