1. Add `bs_themer()` to your server function

```
library(shiny)
library(bslib) # step 1

...

server <- function(input, output){
   bs_themer()
   
   ##cool reactive logic##
}

```

When you make changes in the Preview tool, code for updating your theme is printed to the console. Copy the updates to your Shiny app.

```
my_theme <- bs_theme()

# This line is copied from the console (may need to update theme name)             
my_theme <- bs_theme_update(my_theme, bg = "#4B3E23", fg = "#000000")

```
