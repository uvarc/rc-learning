## File Organization

Project Directory

  - **`slides/`**: contains all the RMarkdown files/slides for this workshop
    - Knit `MAIN.Rmd` to see the main slideshow
    - Each section is a separate RMarkdown file (feel free to take notes in these!)

  - **`projects/`**: contains all the code we'll be working with today
    - Each app will live in a separate directory

  - **`sandbox/`**: place to put code snippets or quick demos
