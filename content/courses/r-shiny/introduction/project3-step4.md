Write reactive logic to:

1. Display the head of the selected data frame in a table (only the response and explanatory variables)

2. Plot response versus explanatory in a scatterplot

You'll be using the `render` functions to create the displays. Is there a way you can create a common object for that can be used by both of the `render` functions? Hint: use `reactive()`
