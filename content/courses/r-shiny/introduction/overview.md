**Shiny is an R package for developing interactive web applications, or apps.** Shiny apps are just webpages!


Webpages are made up of two main components.

1. **HTML/CSS:** what your app looks like (the **form**)

2. **JavaScript:** what your app does (the **function**)

The difference between Shiny apps and regular webpages: **Shiny apps are powered by an R session.**

## Creating a Shiny app

To create a Shiny app, we need:

1. Regular R stuff: writing code to manipulate and analyze data, visualize with graphs, etc...

<br>

2. To create a user interface

3. To connect **1** to **2** with **reactive logic**
