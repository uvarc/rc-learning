It's time to try coding your own Shiny app. With this app, a user will be able to select a data frame from a list of choices, and then select a response and explanatory variable. The app will have 3 types of functionality: 

1. Plot a scatterplot of the data frame (response vs explanatory)

2. Show the head of the data frame

3. Print out a regression report
