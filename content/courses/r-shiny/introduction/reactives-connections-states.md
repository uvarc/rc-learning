## Reactives have connections

* Inputs have outward connections
* Observers have inward connections
* Conductors have both inward and outward connections

## Reactive States

***Reactives have 2 kinds of states***

1. **Their value**, e.g. numerical/text value, plot, image
2. **Their validity**--validated, invalidated

<br>

- Reactives are invalidated when their inputs change value. They become valid again when they recalculate or re-execute based on their input's new value.
