Details of performance optimization, as well as tools for writing, debugging, and profiling code are covered. Topics include:

- Utilizing development tools
- Verifying application behavior
- Creating robust applications
- Structuring code
- Structuring data
- Managing data efficiently

Beginners should complete the [MATLAB Fundamentals](/courses/matlab-programming//fundamentals) tutorial before beginning this workshop.
