C++ is a versatile, widely-used compiled language.  This short course covers the basics, with some discussion of features of the C++11 standard.  Newer codes increasingly use C++14 constructs but not all compilers support those by default yet. 

The best way to learn a programming language is to use it.  We strongly urge you
 to attempt the exercises and projects to practice your coding skills.
