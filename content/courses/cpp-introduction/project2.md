Some languages, such as Python, can split a string on a specified delimiter character and return a list of strings. The delimiter is dropped.  Write a program that can accomplish this.  

This should be a function, but we have not yet covered subprograms, so you may write a monolithic program.  If you wish to look ahead, write this as a function.

Hint: a vector would be a good data structure. It is close to a "list" in Python.

Print the result in Python format, 
```python
[sub1,sub2,sub3]
```
