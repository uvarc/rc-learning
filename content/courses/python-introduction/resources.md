## Resources

This concludes our overview of programming in Python.  The high popularity of Python has ensured that many online resources are available at all skill levels, from beginners to advanced programmers.  One sample listing is at [Fullstack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/best-python-resources.html).  Many online resources emphasize Web programming, but some compilations more specific to sciences and data analytics include [Python for Social Sciences](https://realpython.com/python-for-social-scientists/), [Python Programming for the Humanities](http://www.karsdorp.io/python-course/), [Python for Scientists and Engineers](https://www.pythonforengineers.com/python-for-scientists-and-engineers/) (this is a free online book), and others. A very good list, if you can get past the 1990's look of the site and the occasional dead link, is [Python for Scientific Computing](https://indranilsinharoy.com/2013/01/06/python-for-scientific-computing-a-collection-of-resources/).  Note that you may see references to `continuum.io`; this was the original name of the company that now goes by the name of their product, Anaconda.

Other online tutorials include [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm) and [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/learn/python?utm_source=adwords_ppc&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaignid=1565610360&utm_adgroupid=63334253950&utm_device=c&utm_keyword=python%20programming&utm_matchtype=p&utm_network=g&utm_adpostion=&utm_creative=591601772809&utm_targetid=kwd-116884689&utm_loc_interest_ms=&utm_loc_physical_ms=9008336&gclid=CjwKCAjw682TBhATEiwA9crl3zjHzq2mV9cH_c7P2DpHXcUwsWqcFt3bFLyFSh8U-A6q2kv9lDR9cRoCzIMQAvD_BwE).

Many, many online resources refer to Anaconda, but Anaconda's licensing terms have changed, so be sure that you read and understand them before downloading and installing it. We have recommended Miniforge in this tutorial because it remains free for all users.

Happy programming!
