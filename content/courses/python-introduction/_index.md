Python is one of the most popular programming languages, widely used in areas as diverse as data science and Web programming.  This course is an introduction to programming as well as to the Python language.

Learning to program requires practice and patience.  You cannot learn by watching videos or even reading notes with examples.  You should attempt all the examples throughout this course.  Resist the urge to peek at the solutions as long as you can.  Work throught at least a few of the Projects for each section.

When the course is being offered live the project sample solutions may be unavailable: try them yourself anyway, and return when the solutions are posted again.

Once you have mastered programming in Python, you may find that your scripts are slow.  We offer a course in [High-Performance Python](/courses/python-high-performance) to help you learn to optimize your code.
