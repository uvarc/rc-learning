Functions and modules are self-contained units of code.  They enable us to isolate chunks of code into small packages.  They are important components of _software engineering_.  One principle for designing programs is _separation of concerns_.  A concern, in this context, is a well-defined task or related set of tasks.  Separation of concerns makes the program easier to modify and maintain.
