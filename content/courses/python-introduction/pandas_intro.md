Pandas introduces new data structures, the most important of which are the Series and the DataFrame.

## Series

The Series data structure consists of an index plus data.  It is similar to a dictionary with the differences that 

* the size is fixed
* requesting a non-existent index results in a Key Error (no dynamic creation)

Series objects are one-dimensional and can contain any type.  The indices are treated like row labels.

This simple example loads a Series with normally-distributed random numbers, then prints some of them, prints the basic statistics, and creates a line plot.

Series are conceptually like a single column of a spreadsheet, with any headers omitted.  Values are similar to a NumPy Ndarray and most NumPy methods can be applied to the Series data, provided they are defined on the data type.  Missing data, represented by `np.nan` by default, will be omitted from the data used by these methods.

However, if the values are needed as an actual Ndarray they must be converted.
```
vals=randns.to_numpy()
```

We can load a Series with a dictionary.
```
scores=pd.Series({'Cougars':11,'Bears':9,'Cubs':8,'Tigers':6})
```

We can still slice it
```
scores[1:3]
```

We can still use `iloc` to extract by row number.  We can also use `loc` to extract by the row name.

```
scores.loc['Cubs']
```

Remember to print if using Spyder, or to run in the interpreter pane.

## DataFrames

The most important data structure in Pandas is the _DataFrame_.  It can be conceptualized as a representation of a spreadsheet.  DataFrames are two-dimensional.  Each column has a name, which can be read from the headers of a spreadsheet, rows are numbered, and datatypes may be different in different columns.  Alternatively, a DataFrame may be regarded as a dictionary with values that can be lists, Ndarrays, dictionaries, or Series.

The DataFrame is a _mutable_ type.

We can create a DataFrame by passing a dictionary. Consider a simple grade-book example.

{{< code-snippet >}}
grade_book=pd.DataFrame({"Name":["Jim Dandy","Betty Boop","Minnie Moocher",
                                 "Joe Friday","Teddy Salad"],
                         "Year":[2,4,1,2,3],"Grade":[85.4,91.7,73.2,82.3,98.5]})
{{< /code-snippet >}}

```python
print(grade_book)
```

The result of printing the DataFrame should look like this:

{{< table >}}
| | Name           | Year | Grade |
|-|--------------- | ---- | ----- |
|0| Jim Dandy      | 2    | 85.4  |
|1| Betty Boop     | 4    | 91.7  |
|2| Minnie Moocher | 1    | 73.2  |
|3| Joe Friday     | 2    | 82.3  |
|4| Teddy Salad    | 3    | 98.5  |
{{< /table >}}

Now we can apply methods to the `grade_book` DataFrame.

```python
grade_book.describe() #Summarizes
grade_book.head()     #print first few lines
grade_book.tail()     #print last lines
```
The `head` and `tail` methods are more useful for longer datasets. We can provide them parameters to print a specified number of rows other than the default 5.
```python
grade_book.head(2)
grade_book.tail(1)
```

### Accessing and Modifying Data

We can access individual columns by name.  If the name of the column is a valid Python variable name then we may use it as an attribute; otherwise we must refer to it as we would to a dictionary key.

```python
grade_book.Name
grade_book['Name']
grade_book.Grade.mean()
```
An individual column is of type Series.

Columns can be deleted. This does not change the original dataframe; it returns a new dataframe.  To overwrite the dataframe, add an option `inplace=True`.

```python
grades_only=grade_book.drop(columns='Year')
```

A new column can be appended (the number of rows must be the same)
```python
grade_book["Letter Grade"]=["B","A","C","B","A"]
```

Extract values into an Ndarray
```python
grades=grade_book["Grade"].values
```

To add a row, we should use `concat`.  The number of columns must match.
```python
new_row=pd.DataFrame([["Dinsdale Piranha",1,75.5]],columns=["Name","Year","Grade"])
grade_book=pd.concat([grade_book,new_row],axis=0)
```

To delete a row
```python
grade_book.drop([len(grade_book)-1])
```
This drops the last row.

### Plots

We can directly apply basic Matplotlib commands to DataFrame columns

```python
grade_book.Grade.hist()
grade_book.Grade.plot()
```

**Exercise**

Set up a dataframe with the following "weather" data (it is synthetic):
```no-highlight
Date, Minimum Temp, Maximum Temp
"2000-01-01 00:00:00",-5.87,8.79
"2000-01-02 00:00:00",-3.82,4.78
"2000-01-03 00:00:00",-4.58,5.10
"2000-01-04 00:00:00",-6.40,2.68
"2000-01-05 00:00:00",-5.50,6.18
"2000-01-06 00:00:00",-3.29,4.50
```

Run `describe`.  Print the mean values.  Extract the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature into Ndarrays.  Plot the data using Pandas.
