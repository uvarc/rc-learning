So far the compound types we have studied have been _ordered_.  We access elements by integer _indices_ numbered from `0` to `N-1`, where `N` is the total number of elements.  Dictionaries and sets, in contrast, are _unordered_.  Elements must be accessed by a _key_ for a dictionary.  Set elements are not individually addressable, but it is possible to iterate over a set.
