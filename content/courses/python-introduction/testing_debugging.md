One of the most important skills we must acquire to be a competent programmer is correcting mistakes, or *debugging*. You will probably find that you spend more time debugging than writing the code in the first place. And in order to debug, you must test that your program is working correctly. Testing must be considered from the beginning, before you even start writing your own programs, and should be systematic.
