Files are the main ingredients of our programs.  Our scripts are files; we may have input files; we will usually want some kind of output file.  We can manipulate files in Python without having to go through the operating system's user interface.

## Files, Folders, and Paths

Three major operating systems are in use today; Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Each one does things a little differently.

### Paths and Platforms

The location of a file is specified by its _path_.  The exact format of the path varies somewhat by operating system.  Python uses _forward slashes_ to separate folders, even on Windows where the backslash (`\`) is "native."

Python tends to be rooted in the Linux operating system so some of the vocabulary comes from there.  "Folders" in Windows and MacOS are called **directories** in Linux.  The full path to a file is the tree of all folders/directories that must be traversed to reach it. 

```python
#Windows
filename="C:/Users/You/Desktop/Python Programs/myscript.py"
#MacOS
filename="/Users/You/Desktop/Python Programs/myscript.py"
#Linux
filename="/home/you/python_programs/myscript.py"
```

We can use the `os` module to make our scripts a little more platform-independent.  The `os` module provides access to some basic operating-system functionality, particularly those related to files, in an interface that is uniform across different systems. 

In this example, the `expanduser` function will get the home directory of the user running the script.  For this we must use the `path` submodule of os.
```python
import os
home_dir=os.path.expanduser('~')
```
The tilde `~` stands for the home directory in any operating system.

We can use `path.join` to concatenate directories and paths into complete file names. On Windows, `path.join` understands both forward and backward slashes.

```python
#Windows
dir="Desktop\Python Programs"
#MacOS
dir="Desktop/Python Programs"
#Linux
dir="python_programs"
#All
script="myscript.py"
filename=os.path.join(home_dir,dir,script)
f=open(filename)
```
The `os` module can perform basic file and directory manipulations in a way that is appropriate for each operating system.  

### Changing and Creating Directories

When we run a script, the path from which it is run is the _current working directory_.  Note that JupyterLab and IDEs may set the current working directory their own way.  We can get it through the `os` module and we can change it.

```python
mycwd=os.getcwd()
newpath="/home/you/some_dir"
os.chdir(newpath)
```

To create a new directory, use `mkdir`
```python
os.mkdir(new_dir) #relative to CWD
os.mkdir(fullpath)   #full path
```

### Listing Files

We can list the files in a directory with `listdir` from `os`.  It returns a list.
```python
files=os.listdir() #current working directory
input_directory=os.path.listdir(input_path) #using a full path
```
We can check whether an item is a directory with `os.path.isdir()`, which can also check whether it exists.  Similar for `os.path.isfile()`.
```python
#Starting from CWD
for file in os.listdir():
    if os.path.isdir(file):
        print("{} is a directory".format(file))
    elif os.path.isfile(file):
        print("{} is a file".format(file))
    else:
        print("{} is neither a file nor a directory".format(file))
```

If we do not need a list of the files but only an iterator, we can use `scandir`.  Scandir returns an object, not a string, so we must extract the parts we need.  The advantage to scandir is that it can be faster if we need to test any attributes of the file.  The `with` statement is intended to handle any [exceptions](/courses/python-introduction/exceptions).

### Copying and Moving Files

Another module, [shutil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html), allows us to move and copy files and perform other basic operations on them.

```python
import shutil
shutil.copy(source,destination)
shutil.move(source,destination)
```
In the above, both `source` and `destination` should be either strings or should be paths created by some function such as `os.path.join`.

For more details about the os module, see its [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html).

## Opening a File

Before anything can be done with a file we must _open_ it.  This attaches the file name to the program through some form of _file descriptor_, which is like an identifier for the file.  Once opened we do not refer to the file by its name anymore, but only via the ID.

We open a file and associate an identifier with it by means of the `open` statement.

```python
fp=open("filename")
fin=open("filename","r")
fout=open("filename","w")
```

The default is read-only.  Adding the `r` makes this explicit.  To open for writing only, add the `w`.  This overwrites the file if it already exists.  To append to an existing file, use `a` in place of `w`.  Both `w` and `a` will create the file if it does not exist.  To open for both reading and writing, use `r+`; in this case the file must exist.  To open it for reading and writing even if it does not exist, use `w+`.

## Closing Files

When you have completed all operations on a file you should close it.

```python
fin.close()
fout.close()
```

Files will be automatically closed when your script terminates, but best practice is to close each file yourself as soon as you are done with it.  You _must_ close a file if you intend to open it later in a different mode.  You cannot reopen a file using an active file descriptor.  You must first close it.

**Exercise**

All three major operating systems have a Documents directory by default in their desktop environments.  Write a script to 
 1. change the working directory to the Documents directory.  Use a general way to construct the path.
 2. List all the files in the directory.  Use a string function to check whether any end in ".txt."  OK to use listdir.
 3. Make a new folder "MyTestFolder" in the Documents directory.  Check first whether it already exists.
 4. Open a file "new_file.txt" for writing.
 5. Use the following line to write a little text into it.  Replace "f" with your choice of file identifier.
    f.write("Here are some words for this file.\n")
 6. Close the file.
 7. Move the file into "MyTestFolder."
