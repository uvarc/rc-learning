## Overview

This short course focuses on data analytics and machine learning techniques in MATLAB® using functionality within Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox™ and Neural Network Toolbox™. The course demonstrates the use of unsupervised learning to discover features in large data sets and supervised learning to build predictive models. Examples and exercises highlight techniques for visualization and evaluation of results. Topics include:

  - Organizing and preprocessing data
  - Clustering data
  - Creating classification and regression models
  - Interpreting and evaluating models
  - Simplifying data sets
  - Using ensembles to improve model performance


The material for this course uses selected topics from the online self-paced course from the MathWorks in the link below. Participants should have a Mathworks account in order to access the links in this document.
