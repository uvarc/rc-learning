### Overview

This short course provides a practical introduction to building artificial neural networks using PyTorch, a powerful and flexible deep l
earning framework. The course covers the fundamentals of PyTorch, including tensors, automatic differentiation, and model building. Participants will 
learn how to construct, train, and optimize neural networks while exploring real-world applications. The course also includes best practices for experiment tracking and project setup. By the end of the course, participants will have a solid foundation in PyTorch and be able to develop deep learning models for a variety of tasks.
