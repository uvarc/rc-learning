    - inspect a container
    - run containers interactively and non-interactively
    - navigate container modules
    - submit container jobs via Slurm
    - create custom Jupyter kernels
- Building Containers on HPC [Apptainer]
    - definition file
    - best practices
    - registry
    - case studies
- Appendix 1: Building Containers [Docker]
