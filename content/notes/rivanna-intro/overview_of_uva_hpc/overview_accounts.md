* Allocations and Groups
    * An allocation is associated with a _group_.  Currently this is a [Grouper](https://groups.identity.virginia.edu/) group.
    * Members (but not administrators) of the allocation group automatically receive an account on the system.
    * RC staff do not manage allocation groups.  The PI is responsible for adding and removing group members.  
    * The PI may designate administrators and delegate the task of managing the group to them.
