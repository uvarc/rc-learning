Currently the supercomputer is made up of two systems, Rivanna and Afton, and between the two has 626 nodes with over 20448 cores and 8PB of various storage.

Several queues (or “partitions”) are available to users for different types of jobs. One queue is restricted to single-node (serial or threaded) jobs; another for multi-node parallel programs, and others are for access to specialty hardware such as large-memory nodes or nodes offering GPUs.

More information on queueing policies and hardware configurations can be found on our [website](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/rivanna/overview/).
