Files are the foundation of working with an HPC cluster.  We need to be able to

* Transfer files to and from the cluster
* Edit text files
* Create files through the software we run

Each user has a `home` location and a `scratch` location.  When you log in you will be in the `home` location.  For now we will assume you will work with files in your home folder.  We will discuss the scratch folder later.
