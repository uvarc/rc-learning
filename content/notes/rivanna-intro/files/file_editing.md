Once we have our files on the system, we may need to edit them.  It is a good idea to edit your files directly on the system, rather than editing on your local computer and then transferring them back and forth.

You can create files by the same process as editing an existing one; just select `New` if there is a menu.

You can use:
* The built-in editor in Open OnDemand. Click on Files on the Dashboard, highlight the file that you want to edit. From the dropdown menu next to the file name, select Edit.  A simple editor will open. To create a file, navigate to the desired location, click the New File button, then edit that file.
* If logged in through FastX, you can use the `pluma` editor, which is accessible through the Applications->Accessories menu.  You can also start it from a terminal with either its name `pluma` or as `gedit` (those are the same program).
* The MATE desktop in FastX also provides the semi-graphical editors `Emacs` and `GVim` in the same menu.
* In FastX, you can also use a programmer's interface such as VSCode, Spyder, or Rstudio.  For extensive editing or running programs through environments such as VSCode, use the Open OnDemand [interactive app](notes/rivanna-intro/interactive).
