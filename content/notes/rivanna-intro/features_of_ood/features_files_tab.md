The "Files" tab on the menu bar gives access to all files in home or project (if applicable) directories.

Here, you can upload and download small files to and from the cluster from your local computer. You can also create and delete new files and directories in addition to copying or renaming them. The Filter search bar searches for files or directories in the file system.
