Active users can access free storage for active work.  Research groups that need more permanent storage, or wish to share storage space, can also lease storage.

## No-Cost Storage

Each user has access to a _home directory_ and a _scratch directory_.

### Home Directory

When you log in, you will be in your home directory, e.g. /home/mst3k.  Each home directory on has 50GB of storage capacity.  The home directory is for individual use and is not shareable with other users.

### Scratch Directory

You have access to 10 TB of  <span style="color:#0070C0"> __temporary__ </span> storage. It is located in a subdirectory under `/scratch`, followed by your userID,  e.g.,  `/scratch/mst3k`

The `/scratch` directory is for individual use and is not shareable with other users.

{{< warning  >}}
/scratch is __NOT__ permanent storage and files that have not been accessed for more than 90 days will be marked for deletion.

## Leased Storage

We offer two tiers of leased storage. For rates and offerings see our [website](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/storage/).

### Research Standard Storage

Standard storage is inexpensive but is not backed up, and access can be slow.  

### Research Project Storage

Research project storage provides _snapshots_.  Snapshots are not backups, but are a "snapshot" of the files over a time interval in the past, currently one week.
