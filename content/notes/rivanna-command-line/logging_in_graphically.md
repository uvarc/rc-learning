The command-line secure shell is not the only option for accessing our HPC system. Windows users in particular may wish to use other methods, since although ssh is available for it, Windows is not particularly friendly to command lines.

**Open OnDemand** (OOD)

Open OnDemand is a Web-based interface to the system. It provides a graphical file-management interface and access to several popular applications running on the compute nodes. A simple terminal that opens on a frontend is also provided.
See the introduction in our basic [tutorial](/notes/rivanna-intro/connecting_to_rivanna/connecting_ood).

**FastX**

FastX is a Web-based graphical interface to a frontend. It is also covered in the [introduction](/notes/rivanna-intro/connecting_to_rivanna/connecting_fastx).

**MobaXterm** (Windows)

MobaXterm combines an ssh client, an _sftp_ client for file transfers, and an X11 server into a single bundle. More details are available at our [Website](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/rivanna/logintools/mobaxterm/) or in the [introduction](/notes/rivanna-intro/files/file_moba).
