Create a directory called `newdir`.  Navigate to it.  Make a new file
```bash
$cat > mynewfile
```

Save it as a new empty file with `^d`.  Use nano or another editor of your preference and type a line or two of text.

```bash
$more mynewfile
$ls 
$mv mynewfile the_file
$cp the_file old_file
$ls -l
```
