In most operating systems, all files and directories are located with a **path**.  The “path” is the "full name" of every file & directory.

In a Unix-based operating system, the files are organized into a _tree_ structure.  The tree is "upside down" because the **root directory** is at the top, and directories branch off from there.  The root directory is indicated with a forward slash `/`.

The **home** directory is the usual name on Linux and similar Unix-based operating systems for the folder that holds user directories and files.  On MacOS it is called User.  On both, the _separator_ between branches of the tree is the forward slash.

Windows files and folders also have paths.  In Windows, drive letters or _volumes_ are the top-level folders, and usually there is more than one.  User files are in Users, similar to MacOS.
