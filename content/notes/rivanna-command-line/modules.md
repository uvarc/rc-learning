_Environment modules_ are not strictly a part of Unix, but are widely used by many HPC sites, including ours.  Modules enable the user to set complex paths, environment variables, and so forth, simply by loading a module.

The commands are set up automatically when you log in.  Loaded modules only affect the shell in which the command is run.

Modules required for a job must be loaded in the batch _job script_.
