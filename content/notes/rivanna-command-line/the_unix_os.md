__UNIX__ : is a text-oriented operating system (OS) originally developed at Bell Labs during the 1960s. Two versions of this OS are dominant today, _Linux_ and _Mac OS_. 

Strictly speaking, "Linux" refers just to the _kernel_, which is the part of an operating system that manages the hardware interfaces.  On top of the kernel sits a number of utilities that enable users and applications to interact with the kernel. 

Linux is the operating system most widely used at HPC facilities, internet servers, and the majority of financial trading system worldwide. A version of Linux powers Android systems.  

Mac OS is based on a slightly different version of Unix.
