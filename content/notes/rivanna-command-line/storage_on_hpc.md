The default home directory provides 50GB of storage capacity, e.g., /home/mst3k.  Each user also has access to 10 TB of  __temporary__  storage in the "scratch" folder, e.g. /scratch/mst3k

The /home and /scratch directories are for personal use and not shareable with other users.

{{< warning >}}
/scratch is NOT permanent storage and files that have not been accessed for more than 90 days will be marked for deletion.

Research groups can lease permanent [storage](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/storage/).
