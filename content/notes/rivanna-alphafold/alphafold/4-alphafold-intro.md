**AlphaFold** is a protein structure prediction system developed by DeepMind. It uses deep learning to predict the 3D structure of proteins directly from their amino acid sequence.

It is built on a neural network architecture with multiple different modules trained simultaneously using end-to-end learning.

AlphaFold's operational stages: 
- AlphaFold searches genetic databases to find sequences that are homologous to the input protein. 
- It passes these homologous sequences into a pre-trained neural network to predict the 3D positions of atoms in the protein.
- The neural network output is refined using molecular dynamics simulations to produce PDB files. A PDB file is the standard format for representing 3D protein structures. 

AlphaFold has both monomer and multimer versions. It is based largely on coevolutionary information.
