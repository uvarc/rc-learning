AlphaFold uses two confidence metrics: PAE and pLDDT.

### **PAE: Predicted Aligned Error**

PAE is the expected position error at residue X when predicted and true structures are aligned on residue Y.

### **pLDDT: Predicted Local Distance Difference Test**

pLDDT is a per-residue confidence score (0â€“100).
It is a "superposition-free score that evaluates local distance differences of all atoms in a model, including validation of stereochemical plausibility."
