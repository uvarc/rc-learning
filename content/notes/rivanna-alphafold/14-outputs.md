After running AlphaFold, your output directory will include a mix of files from different sources:

- The `.csv`, `.txt`, and `.png` files are generated by **AlphaPickle**.
- The `.pdf` file (`CB1_short_msa_sequence_coverage.pdf`) comes from the **sequence_coverage_plot_fxn.py** script.
- All other files — including `.pdb`, `.pkl`, `.json`, and the `msas/` directory — are outputs from **base AlphaFold**.

> The `ranked_0` files represent the **best-ranked model** based on AlphaFold's internal confidence scoring.
