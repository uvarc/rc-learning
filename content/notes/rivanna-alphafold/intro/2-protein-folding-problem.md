It is estimated that there are over 200 million proteins across all species in nature.  [(Source)](https://www.allthescience.org/how-many-proteins-exist.htm)
  
As of 2025, only about 174,000 protein structures have been solved and deposited in the **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**. [(Source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank)

This massive gap between known sequences and solved structures is known as the **protein folding problem**.

**AlphaFold** addresses this problem using AI to predict protein structures from amino acid sequences â€” at scale and with high accuracy.
