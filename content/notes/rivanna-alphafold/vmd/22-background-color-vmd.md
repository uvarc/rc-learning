VMD is very customizable. You can change colors of almost anything, select different parts of your molecule, etc.

To change the background color:

1. In the **VMD Main** window, go to the **Graphics** menu.
2. Select **Colors...**
3. In the **Color Controls** window, under the *Categories* list, select **Display**.
4. In the *Names* list, select **Background**.
5. Choose a new color from the *Colors* list or modify the RGB sliders in the *Color Definitions* tab.
