To view your predicted structure generated by AlphaFold in 3D, you can use **Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD)**.

Steps: 
* Log onto Open On Demand ([https://rivanna-portal.hpc.virginia.edu/](https://rivanna-portal.hpc.virginia.edu/))
* Choose the ‘Desktop’ interactive app and fill out the webform with your required resources.
* Click launch. 
* Load VMD in the terminal:
```bash
module load vmd
vmd
```
The VMD windows will launch. From there, you can open your `.pdb` file from the AlphaFold output directory to view the 3D model (colored by `pLDDT`).
