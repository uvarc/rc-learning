Alphafold has a database of 200 million structure predictions, so why do we need to bother running monomer version anymore?
	special use-cases such as: engineered proteins, chimeric proteins, novel proteins translated from newly recognized ORFs, etc. 
	OR protein complexes = use alphafold multimer

DeepMind and EMBLâ€™s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) have partnered to create AlphaFold DB to make these predictions freely available to the scientific community. The latest database release contains over 200 million entries, providing broad coverage of UniProt (the standard repository of protein sequences and annotations). We provide individual downloads for the human proteome and for the proteomes of 47 other key organisms important in research and global health. We also provide a download for the manually curated subset of UniProt (Swiss-Prot).
