{{< figure src=/notes/rivanna-alphafold/img/Alphafold_34.png caption="Predicted 3D structure of CB1." >}}

The above image shows the 3D structure from the `ranked_0.pdb` file. The structure is colored by `pLDDT`, where dark blue represents high confidence and red represents low confidence.

CB1 is a 7-transmembrane domain (7TM) septa-helical protein with less-structured tails on both termini.
This is reflected in the 3D structure, where disordered regions ("ribbons") are low-confidence and helices are high-confidence.

This schematic complements the 3D model by showing the membrane topology of CB1. The arrangement of helices and loops explains the structured and unstructured regions seen in the AlphaFold prediction.

>The GPCR N-terminus (5’/start of protein) is extracellular, and the C-terminus (3’/end of protein) is intracellular. There is a loop between each transmembrane alpha-helix; one loop is longer than the others, which is why you see it is more unstructured. This GPCR happens to have a couple short helices in its C terminal structure as well, but mostly the tails are disordered/unstructured.
