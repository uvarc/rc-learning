From there, you can launch a Desktop session on Rivanna.

Choose your desired resources (cores, memory, time, etc.). 

Note: You must have a valid allocation to launch a job.
The `rivanna-training` allocation is no longer supported for AlphaFold jobs.

If you are part of a lab or course, use the allocation provided to you (e.g., `yourgroup-allocation`).
If you're unsure what to use, contact your PI or the RC support team for help.


Once your session is ready, click the blue "Launch Desktop" button.

Youâ€™ll be placed in a Linux environment like this:

Use the MATE Terminal to run commands or load software modules.
