## Directory Contents

The `alphafold` directory can contain the following:

- **SLURM job scripts (`*.slurm`)**  
  Several SLURM scripts are provided for submitting AlphaFold jobs for different use cases.

- **`fasta/`**  
  This subdirectory contains the FASTA files required for both monomer and multimer AlphaFold runs.

- **`conda/`**  
  This is a Conda environment that includes the necessary Python packages for running the `alphapickle` utility and the `sequence_coverage_plot.py` script.

- **`alphapickle/`**  
  This folder contains a GitHub package used to generate human-readable quality control plots and metric files (in `.csv` and `.txt` format) as well as QC plots from the `.pkl` results generated by AlphaFold.

- **`sequence_coverage_plot.py`**  
  This is a custom script, modified from the [VIBFold project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasperzuallaert/VIBFold/main/visualize_alphafold_results.py), which generates sequence coverage plots using information from the `features.pkl` file.

- **`outdir/`**  
  This directory is the destination for output files produced during AlphaFold runs.
