Sequence coverage plots (`*_sequence_coverage.pdf`) show the alignment depth along the length of the protein. 

{{< figure src=/notes/rivanna-alphafold/img/Alphafold_27.png width=85% height=85% caption="Sequence coverage plot for CB1. Darker colors indicate higher identity to the query sequence.">}}

This example has a depth of ~13,000 sequences, with varying levels of homology to the query.
The CB1 protein is a 7-transmembrane (7TM) helical protein with less-structured tails on both termini — which is also reflected in its 3D structure predictions.
