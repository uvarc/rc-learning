After running AlphaFold, your output directory will include a mix of files from different sources:

- The `.csv`, `.txt`, and `.png` files are generated by **AlphaPickle**.
- `.pdf` files typically come from the **sequence_coverage_plot_fxn.py** script.
- All other files — including `.pdb`, `.pkl`, `.json`, and the `msas/` directory — are outputs from **base AlphaFold**.

> Files labeled `ranked_0` represent the **best-ranked model** based on AlphaFold's internal confidence scoring.
