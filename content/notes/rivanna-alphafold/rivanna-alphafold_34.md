GPCR N-terminus (5’/start of protein) is extracellular, C-terminus (3’/end of protein) is intracellular. There is a loop between each transmembrane alpha-helix, one loop is longer than the others which is why you see it is more unstructured. This GPCR happens to have a couple short helices in its C terminal structure as well, but mostly the tails are disordered/unstructured
