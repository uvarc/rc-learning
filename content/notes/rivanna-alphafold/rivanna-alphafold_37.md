ranked_0.pdb (best model)

Colored by pLDDT

Dark blue = high confidence

Red = low confidence

7-transmembrane domain septa-helical protein with less-structured tails on both termini  reflected in 3D structure

Disordered regions (“ribbons”) are low-confidence

Helices are high-confidence

---

GPCR N-terminus (5’/start of protein) is extracellular, C-terminus (3’/end of protein) is intracellular. There is a loop between each transmembrane alpha-helix, one loop is longer than the others which is why you see it is more unstructured. This GPCR happens to have a couple short helices in its C terminal structure as well, but mostly the tails are disordered/unstructured
