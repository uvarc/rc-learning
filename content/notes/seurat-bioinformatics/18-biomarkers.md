Our dataset has known canonical biomarkers (PBMC = peripheral blood mononuclear cells). We can use these canonical biomarkers to name our clusters based on cell type. 

{{< table >}}
| Cluster ID | Markers | Cell Type |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | IL7R, CCR7 | Naive CD4+ T |
| 1 | CD14, LYZ | CD14+ Mono |
| 2 | IL7R, S100A4 | Memory CD4+ |
| 3 | MS4A1 | B |
| 4 | CD8A | CD8+ T |
| 5 | FCGR3A, MS4A7 | FCGR3A+ Mono |
| 6 | GNLY, NKG7 | NK |
| 7 | FCER1A, CST3 | DC |
| 8 | PPBP | Platelet |
