Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) involves isolating and sequencing individual cells to measure gene expression.

{{< figure src=/notes/seurat-bioinformatics/img/seurat_workshop_20230407_0.jpg width=75% height=75% >}}

This diagram illustrates the basic workflow of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq): starting with a tissue sample, individual cells are isolated and sequenced to measure gene expression. The resulting read counts form a matrix of genes by cells, which can then be analyzed to compare gene expression profiles, identify clusters of similar cells, and visualize patterns using techniques like heatmaps and dimensionality reduction.
