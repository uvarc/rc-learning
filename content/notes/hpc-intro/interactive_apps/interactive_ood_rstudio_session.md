Once you launch/submit your request, your job will wait in the queue until resources are available. You'll then be able to connect to your session:

{{< figure src="/notes/hpc-intro/img/OOD_Rstudio_session2.png" caption="Starting an Rstudio session." >}}

Rstudio Server can continuing running any active processes if your network is disconnected.  Simply log back in to Open OnDemand, go to the My Interactive Sessions tab, and click `Launch`  again.  It will reconnect, not launch another session.
