FastX is a Web-based desktop environment for HPC. It is accessible either through the [Open OnDemand Interactive Apps](/notes/hpc-intro/ood_interactive_apps) menu, or directly at [rivanna-desktop.hpc.virginia.edu](https://rivanna-desktop.hpc.virginia.edu).

FastX requires the VPN.  If the VPN is not active, the start page _will not_ load.

Always use either the OOD link or the `rivanna-desktop` URL.  The underlying name of the host may change from time to time.
