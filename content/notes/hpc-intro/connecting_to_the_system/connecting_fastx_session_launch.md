Most users should choose the MATE session.  

{{< figure src="/notes/hpc-intro/img/FastX_session_launch.png" caption="Starting a MATE session" alt="Applications pane with two icons: one for 'MATE' showing a computer monitor, and one for 'Terminal' showing a terminal window with three dots.">}}

Click the icon, then click the play button on the MATE session under "Disconnected Sessions" on the page. This will open a new window with two options: Browser Client, and Desktop Client.

{{< figure src="/notes/hpc-intro/img/FastX_connect_options.png" caption="Browser or Desktop Client" alt="Webpage prompting user to choose a connection method. Two options are shown: 'Browser Client' with a browser icon and the text 'Connect with the browser. No download required!', and 'Desktop Client' with a desktop icon and the text 'Connect with the desktop client for the best user experience!'" >}}

Select the Browser Client to connect to your session.
