A MATE desktop looks a little like an older Windows desktop. In the ribbon at the top are `Caja`, a file manager; a `Terminal` application, and the Firefox Web browser.   

{{< figure src="/notes/hpc-intro/img/FastX_desktop.png" caption="The MATE Desktop" alt="FastX MATE desktop environment with a top panel containing icons for Caja file manager, Terminal, and Firefox web browser, and desktop icons for Computer, user's Home, and Trash.">}}
