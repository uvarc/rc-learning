You have several options for transferring data onto your home or scratch directories.

* Use a drag-and-drop option with [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net) (Windows) or [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) (Mac OS and Linux).
* For small files, use the Upload and Download buttons in the Open OnDemand FileExplorer App.
* Use the scp command from a Terminal. 
* Use the web browser in the FastX desktop to download data from UVA Box or other cloud locations.
* Use the git clone command to copy git repositories
* Set up a [Globus](https://globus.org) endpoint on your laptop and use the Globus web interface to transfer files.
See [the RC website's Globus page](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/globus/) for details.
