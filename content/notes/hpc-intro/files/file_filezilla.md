## Filezilla

This illustration is from a Linux computer.  Mac OS is similar.

First click the Site Manager icon in the upper left.

Select New Site.  Rename it.  Fill in the text boxes and dropdown.  Be sure to select SFTP in the Protocol box.  As for MobaXTerm, we recommend using a specific host name.  Click `OK` to save and `Connect` to initiate the connection.  A multiple-pane window similar to that of MobaXTerm will open.
