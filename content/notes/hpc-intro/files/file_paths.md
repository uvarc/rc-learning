Every file has a full name called its _path_. The path provides the operating system with the exact location of the file, relative to some starting point.

Examples:
* Windows
    `C:\Users\mst3k\Desktop\mystuff.txt`
* Mac OS
    `/Users/mst3k/Desktop/mystuff.txt`
* Linux (usually)
    `/home/mst3k/Desktop/mystuff.txt`

These paths traverse through some _folders_, which in Linux are often called **directories**, to arrive at the file `mystuff.txt`
