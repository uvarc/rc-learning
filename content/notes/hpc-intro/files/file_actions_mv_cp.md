## Renaming Files and Folders
* In the Open OnDemand File Explorer, click on Files on the Dashboard and click the file or folder you want to rename.  Find the menu (three vertical dots) to the right of the file name.  Click Rename.
* In the "Caja" file manager on FastX, select the file or folder.  The combination of clicking on the icon and hitting the F2 key, should work on most keyboards as it does for Windows.  You can also right-click and choose Rename. 

## Moving Files and Folders
* In the Open OnDemand File Explorer, use the Copy/Move button in the upper right.  Select the file or folder you wish to move.  A dialog will open.  In your navigation pane, go to the target folder.  Click Copy in the dialog on the left.   
* In the "Caja" file manager on FastX, if moving within the same parent folder, just drag the file or folder to the new location.  If moving between folders that do not share a parent, open another Caja window.  `Cut` the file or folder and `paste` to its new location.

## Copying Files and Folders
* In the Open OnDemand File Explorer, use the `Copy/Move` button, but click on Copy rather than Move.
* In the "Caja" file manager on FastX, open another Caja window and drag the icon of the file or folder between them.  Alternatively right-click and use the `copy` and `paste` menu items.
