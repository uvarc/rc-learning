Time on the HPC cluster is _allocated_.

* An allocation refers to a block of CPU time that you can use to run your computations.
* Only faculty may request an allocation. Research staff may apply for an exception.
  * Students must be sponsored by a faculty or research staff.
  * All individuals on a given allocation share the service units.
* Allocations may be requested at [https://www\.rc\.virginia\.edu/userinfo/rivanna/allocations/](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/rivanna/allocations/)
* Allocations are measured in service units (SUs), where __1 SU = 1 core\-hour__ in most cases.  Nodes equipped with GPUs may charge more than one SU per core-hour.
