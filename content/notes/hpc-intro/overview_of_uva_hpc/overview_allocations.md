Time on the HPC cluster is _allocated_.

* An allocation refers to a block of CPU time that you can use to run your computations.
* Only faculty may request an allocation. Research staff may apply for an exception.
  * Students must be sponsored by a faculty or research staff.
  * All individuals on a given allocation share the service units.
* Allocations may be requested at [https://www\.rc\.virginia\.edu/userinfo/rivanna/allocations/](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/rivanna/allocations/)
* Allocations are measured in service units (SUs), which represent the total usage of hardware resources over a period of time (i.e., CPU+Memory+GPU per core-hour). The SU charge rate can vary based on the [hardware](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/hpc/#system-details) used. Newer hardware and GPUs will charge more SUs.
