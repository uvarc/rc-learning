Currently the supercomputer is made up of two systems, Rivanna and Afton, and between the two has 903 nodes with over 49,276 cores and 8PB of various storage.

Several queues (or “partitions”) are available to users for different types of jobs. One queue is restricted to single-node (serial or threaded) jobs; another for multi-node parallel programs, and others are for access to specialty hardware such as nodes offering GPUs.

More information on queueing policies and hardware configurations can be found on [the Research Computing website](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/rivanna/overview/ "The RC website's HPC overview page").
