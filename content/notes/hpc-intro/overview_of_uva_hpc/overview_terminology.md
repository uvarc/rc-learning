## Terminology
### Node
A _node_ is the basic building block of a cluster.
Nodes are a type of computer called a _server_.  
They generally have more power than a typical computer, and they may have specialty hardware like graphical processing units.

Two types of nodes:
* **Head Node** – a server used for logging in and submitting jobs.
* **Compute Node** – a server that carries out the computational work.

### Core 
A core is an individual processor on a computer.
 The cluster's nodes have many cores (typically 40 each).

### Memory
Memory refers to the random-access memory on a node.

### Storage
Storage refers to the disk storage visible from a node.
