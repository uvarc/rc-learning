Open OnDemand allows you to check the status of your jobs easily.  Open the Jobs tab and go to Active Jobs.  The default view is All Jobs.

You can filter to select subsets of the jobs, for example you can view only jobs in the `gpu` partition.

You can also look at the status of only your own jobs by switching from All Jobs to My Jobs.
