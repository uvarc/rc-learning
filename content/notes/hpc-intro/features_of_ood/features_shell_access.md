The "Clusters" tab on the menu bar open a new browser tab with a Linux command line interface for shell access:

{{< figure src="/notes/hpc-intro/img/features_shell_access.png" caption="Command line Shell Access" >}}

To get a feel of how to use the command line, type the command `allocations` after the `$` prompt to display information on your allocations.

This is a suitable method to access the cluster through command line without connecting to the UVA VPN.

On this tab is also a System Status page. This will show an overview of the usage of the entire cluster. This may not be informative since it does not show usage by partition.
