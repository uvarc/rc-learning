Start an Open OnDemand File Explorer tab.  In your home directory, create a new file.  Use the Editor to enter the following text:

> I came in with Halley's Comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don't go out with Halley's Comet. The Almighty has said, no doubt: "Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together." 
>
>-Mark Twain

Name the file whatever you wish.  Make a new folder "Quotes."  Move the file to this directory.  

Go to the FastX desktop and open Caja (the filing-cabinet icon, or from the System Tools menu).  Navigate to your new directory.  Change the name of the file.  Use whatever method you prefer (right-click or F2 key).  Still in Caja, copy the file.  Give the copy the original name you choose.  Move it to your Desktop.

Return to your Desktop in OOD and delete the file there.

On FastX, return to the Quotes directory.  Open the file with Pluma, and after "Mark Twain" add ", 1909".
