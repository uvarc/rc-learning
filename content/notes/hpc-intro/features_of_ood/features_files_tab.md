The "Files" tab on the menu bar gives access to all files in home, scratch, standard or project (if applicable) directories.

{{< figure src="/notes/hpc-intro/img/OOD_files_tab.png" caption="OOD Files Menu" alt="The UVA OpenOnDemand menu bar with 'Home Directory' in the Files dropdown selected. This opens a webpage with a row of buttons for file actions, checkboxes for showing owner/mode and dotfiles, a filter box, and a list of directories and files." >}}


Here, you can upload and download small files to and from the cluster from your local computer. You can also create and delete new files and directories in addition to copying or renaming them. The Filter search bar searches for files or directories in the file system. A link to the [file transfer application Globus](https://learning.rc.virginia.edu/notes/hpc-intro/files/file_globus/) is also provided.
