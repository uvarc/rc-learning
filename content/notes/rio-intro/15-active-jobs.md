The Jobs tab on the OOD menu bar contains the active jobs tab. This shows all jobs currently running or queued on all partitions for all users. You can filter the search for **All Jobs** or **Your Jobs**. 

The Filter search bar allows you to narrow jobs by either user, queue, job name, job ID, or job status (running, queued, completed). More job details can be viewed using the dropdown to the left of a given job. Completed jobs will be visible only for a short while as they are exiting.
