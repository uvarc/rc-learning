Principal Investigators (PIs) can request access by submitting an Ivy Linux VM request through the [services app](https://services.rc.virginia.edu/).

Research staff may apply for an exception.
  
Students must be sponsored by a faculty or research staff.
  
In addition to being a login node to Rio, a Linux VM can be used for preliminary computations as well.

VMs comes in different sizes. Request a VM sized appropriately for your workflow. For larger groups or projects with computationally intensive tasks, choose a larger VM. We recommend Small and above.

VMs exist in a private, secure network and cannot reach outside resources on the Internet. Most inbound and outbound data transfer is managed through the Data Transfer Node (DTN).

More information on requesting a VM can be found [here on the RC website](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/ivy/ "The Research Computing website's Ivy page").
