**Globus** is the only permitted data-transfer protocol for highly sensitive data.

**UVA IVY-DTN** is the the official collection for moving files into High-Security Research Standard Storage.

To transfer data to High-Security Research Standard Storage, please see the special instructions [here on the RC website](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/ivy/).

> Ensure that you are  __NOT__ connected to the HSVPN. Data transfer will not work if you are connected to the HSVPN.

Additional instructions and information on using Globus can be found [here on the RC learning site](https://learning.rc.virginia.edu/tutorials/globus-data-transfer/).
