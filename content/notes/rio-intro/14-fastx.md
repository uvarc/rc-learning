FastX Desktop is a great tool for managing files and launching applications with a graphical user interface.

{{< figure src=/notes/rio-intro/img/rio-intro_7.jpg caption="FastX Dashboard" alt="Screenshot of the FastX dashboard showing the “My Sessions” window with options to launch a MATE desktop environment or a terminal session. A sidebar includes buttons for launching a session and managing bookmarks." width=80% height=80% >}}

Once signed-in, you can select either a "MATE" (GUI Linux Desktop) or "Terminal" session

MATE sessions provide a terminal (black box in menu bar) and a file browser (white box) in menu bar. The CAJA file browser can help with management and navigation of the filesystem.

The desktop background shows icons for “Computer,” “egg3xa’s Home,” and “Trash.” The file browser displays folders such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Public, R, Templates, and an untitled Jupyter notebook file." width=90% height=90% >}}
