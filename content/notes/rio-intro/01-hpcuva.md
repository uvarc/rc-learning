High Performance Computing (HPC) systems are tailored to data sensitivity. 

**Rivanna/Afton (Standard Security)**

These systems are used to process and store public data, internal use data, or sensitive data. Highly Sensitive Data (HSD) is not permissible. 

> <small>More information on the SSZ HPC can be found in our [Intro to HPC slides](https://learning.rc.virginia.edu/notes/hpc-intro/). </small>

**Rio (High Security)**

Rio is designed for processing and storing HSD such as HIPAA, FERPA, dbGAP, etc. 

Rio is not CUI certified yet; use the Ivy VM instead.
