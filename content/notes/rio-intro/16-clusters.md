The Clusters tab on the OOD menu bar opens a new browser tab with a Linux command line interface for shell access. This gives you terminal access to the frontend Ivy VM, similar to logging in via SSH. Here, you can manipulate files, install software packages for Python & R, and submit command line jobs. Running processes here does not utilize Rio compute node resources.
