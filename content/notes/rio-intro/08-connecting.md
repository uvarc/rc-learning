Before connecting to your VM, you must install the following on your workstation.
  * Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.
  * Opswat.
  * Duo MFA on personal smartphone.
  * See [here on the RC website](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/ivy/ "The Research Computing website's Ivy page") for details.

There are two ways to connect to your Linux VM:

1. Accessing the VM from a browser window
2. Using SSH (Secure Shell)
    * Use a terminal window with Mac/Linux
    * Windows users will need to install an SSH client application. We recommend [MobaXTerm](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/hpc/logintools/mobaxterm/ "The Research Computing website's MobaXterm guide").

In either case, you need the IP address of your VM along with your Netbadge credentials to connect to the VM.
