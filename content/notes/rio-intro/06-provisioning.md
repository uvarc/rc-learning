After access is requested, the Research Computing (RC) team will handle the provisioning of the Virtual Machine (VM).

First, the RC team will create a Grouper group for Rio access.

Next, the RC team will request access to the High Security VPN (HSVPN) on your group's behalf and provision 1 TB of High Security Research Standard storage for your project. This storage volume will also be available when using Rio HPC for your project.

The PI and researchers will be notified upon the completion of the VM provisioning, and the associated IP address and group name will be provided to them.
