Editing files in a Linux virtual machine can be done using several text editors, depending on whether you are working in a terminal window or within the desktop environment.

When working in a Terminal Window, use command-line editors such as `vi`, `emacs`, or `pluma`. 

When working in the Desktop environment, you can use the Pluma Text Editor.
