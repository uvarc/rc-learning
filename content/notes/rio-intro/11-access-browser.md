Steps:

1. Start the HSVPN
2. Open a web browser and enter the IP address for your VM (e.g., `https://10.xxx.xxx.xxx`). If you get a warning message, you may need to click on Advanced Settings and/or a Connect Anyway option, depending on your web browser.
3. Upon login, you will see a selection of different graphical applications that you can use.

These applications run on the VM itself and do not use HPC resources.
