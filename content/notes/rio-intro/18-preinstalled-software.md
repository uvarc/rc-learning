Every Virtual Machine comes with a base installation of software by default. See [here on the RC website](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/ivy/ivy-linux-sw/) for a list of preinstalled software and how to request new software installations.

Additional software packages are pre-approved and available for installation upon request. Software not already approved will need to undergo a security evaluation to determine if it is suitable for a High Security environment.

Python and R packages are available to users through the normal `pip`, `conda`, and `CRAN` library installation methods.

Access to installed software is done using the `lmod` Module System.
