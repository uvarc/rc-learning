**Ivy**

Ivy is a secure computing environment, offering Virtual Machines (VM) with both Linux and Windows operating systems.

Ivy VM is designed for interactive and small-scale analysis of highly sensitive data including HIPAA, FERPA, and CUI.

Access to the Ivy platform is project based. Each project gets a VM.

Project-specific storage volumes are mounted to the VM and available on the HPC system enabling a seamless transition between tasks on VM and HPC environment.

Ivy Linux VMs can serve as a frontend for accessing the Rio HPC system (available upon request).

**Rio**

Rio is used for large-scale analysis of HIPAA, FERPA, and CAD.
