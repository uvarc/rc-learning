SSH clients mostly use instructions typed at the command prompt.

You will need to become familiar with Linux/Unix commands. 

Some useful Unix/Linux commands:

```bash
$ ls
```
```bash
$ pwd
```
```bash
$ cd  _folder_name_
```
```bash
$ cp file_1	file_2
```
```bash
$ rm file_1
```
```bash
$ cd ..
```
