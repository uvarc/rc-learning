Any users of the VM must be added to the project in the [services app](https://services.rc.virginia.edu/) by the PI.

Once a project is approved, a PI and her/his researchers must sign a RUDA (one for every researcher on each project).

Each researcher must also complete the  _[High Security Awareness Training (HSAT)](http://in.virginia.edu/hsat-training)_. This must be completed to permit each researcher access to the HSVPN filter.
