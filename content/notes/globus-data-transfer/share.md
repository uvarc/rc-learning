Globus users are able to share data with anyone with a Globus account. All UVA Rivanna and Ivy users have Globus accounts (authenticate with Netbadge).

External collaborators donâ€™t need to be affiliated with an institution using Globus in order for you to share data with them. Anyone can create a personal Globus account using @globusid.org

The instructions below show how to create a **shared endpoint**, a folder in which collaborators can upload and download data. Shared endpoints may be public (visible to the world!) or accessible only to users with permission.

**Instructions** 

1. Select the file or folder you want to share.
2. Click the `Share` button.
3. Click "Add a Guest Collection."
4. Enter a name and description for the Shared Endpoint. This should be unique and easy to remember.
5. Click "Create Guest Collection".
6. Click "Add Permissions  Share With".
7. Enter the UVA or Globus ID of the user you want to share with. Your collaborators must have a Globus ID; email is not sufficient.
8. Click "Add" and "Add Permission".

Optional: Add write permissions so the user can upload data. Enter an email message to the recipient if you wish.
