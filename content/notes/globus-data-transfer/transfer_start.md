You can optionally click the transfer options box to set specific parameters for your transfer.

- By default, transfers on UVA DTNs are synced (option 1) and encrypted (option 5) – no need to select them.

- Files with errors will cause the entire transfer to fail – skip files with errors instead (option 6).

- You can schedule one-time and regular transfers with Timer.

- When ready, click the blue <span style=color:blue>Start</span> button that points in the appropriate direction. When complete, the new folder will appear in the destination pane.
