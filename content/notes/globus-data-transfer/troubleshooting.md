Some problems occur frequently. Here are a few tips to solve them:

{{< table >}}
| Common Issues | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| I have admin privileges on my Health System computer. Why isn’t the Globus installation working? | Sometimes the Health System firewall prevents Globus software from connecting to the mothership. Ask HIT to remote in and complete the installation. |
| Why won’t my transfer to Ivy storage start? | Globus doesn’t work while connected to the High Security VPN. Disconnect while transferring data. |
| Globus is transferring folders but they’re all empty. | There is probably a file with bad permissions or characters in the filename. Choose “Skip files with errors” in the Transfer options |
| I can’t connect to UVA Standard Security Storage. | When leaving UVA, your Eservices account can expire before your email – meaning no Globus access. |
