Halicin is fished out by combining the tanimoto similarity with training set and clinical toxicity values with primary focus on lower toxicity and phase 1/2/3 study (Halicin shown as yellow circle)

Lowest similarity with training set is our primary target

Experiment shows Halicinâ€™s low MIC value of 2 microgram/mL

Chemprop helped in the identification a potential new compound with antibiotic-like properties
