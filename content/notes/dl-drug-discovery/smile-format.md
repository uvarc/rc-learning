The same chemical compound can be represented in multiple ways â€” by its structural diagram, its full chemical name, or in a format interpretable by machine learning models. The **SMILES format** (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a line notation that encodes molecular structures as strings, allowing computers to process chemical information efficiently.

In the example shown above, **2-thiobarbituric acid** is displayed in three forms:

- **Chemical name**: 2-thioxodihydropyrimidine-4,6(1H,5H)-dione  
- **SMILES string**: `O=C1CC(=O)NC(=S)N1`  
- **Structural diagram**

When preparing data for training models, it's important to **split the dataset meaningfully** based on chemical properties. Instead of random splits, a **scaffold-based split** groups compounds by their core structure, which provides a more realistic and chemically meaningful distribution for testing model performance.
