__A deep learning approach to antibiotic discovery, Stokes et al, Cell, 2020__

US-FDA approved drug library containing 1760 molecules of diverse structure and function

800 natural products from plants, animals, and microbial sources

A total of 2,560 molecules tested for relative growth

Red = inhibitory action; Blue = non-inhibitory action

Deduplication resulted in 2,335 molecules

Small dataset hence learning is augmented by several features such as by including hundreds of molecular features, hyperparameter optimizations, ensembling
