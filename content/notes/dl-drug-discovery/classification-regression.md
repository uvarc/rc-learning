Classification categorizes data into classes, while regression predicts continuous values based on relationships between variables.

Regression models seek to uncover and quantify the relationship between variables.

Classification models can have binary or multivariate classification.

Chemprop gives researchers the ability to do both classification and regression. This tutorial will show an example of regression.
