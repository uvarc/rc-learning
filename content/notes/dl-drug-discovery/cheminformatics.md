Cheminformatics is a key area in small-molecule therapeutics that focuses on representing and analyzing chemical data in a form computers can understand. This typically involves creating graphs, fingerprints, or using chemical descriptors to encode molecular structures-—sometimes converting 3D structures into simplified 2D formats.

The field relies heavily on **data collection**, which is essential for any modeling or prediction task. Once data is collected, it must be processed—-deciding what organic reactions to model, which compound libraries or databases to use, and what kind of computational model to generate.

Another major component is **data mining**, where the goal is to extract valuable insights—such as predicting a property, identifying relevant analogues, or navigating chemical databases. In this workshop, the focus is on mining molecular properties, a critical step in optimizing drug candidates.
