#### Screening the ZINC Library with Chemprop

Following the discovery of Halicin, the Chemprop model was scaled up to screen for additional antibiotic candidates. 
The researchers applied the model to a massive chemical space — the **ZINC compound library**, which contains over 107 million molecules.

#### Large-Scale In-Silico Screening

The figure below shows the results of this large-scale screen.  
Out of the full set, the model predicted thousands of molecules to have high activity scores.  
These were filtered based on prediction confidence.

Panel C: High-scoring compounds (yellow) selected for follow-up based on their predicted antibiotic activity and structural novelty." >}}

#### Experimental Testing of Top Candidates

From this screen, several top candidates were selected for experimental testing.  
Two of the compounds — **ZINC000100032716** and **ZINC000225434673** — showed strong promise in lab experiments.
