In the optimization stage, the goal is to understand and improve properties of small molecule compounds.

Deep learning can enhance prediction accuracy and efficiency.

**Directed Message Passing Neural Networks (D-MPNNs)** are deep learning models that learn molecular structures by passing information along directed edges in the molecular graph.

**Chemprop**, developed at MIT, uses D-MPNNs for predicting molecular properties.

Note: Chemprop is not well-suited for peptides.
