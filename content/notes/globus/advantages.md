Globus provides a secure, unified interface to your research data. Use Globus to "fire and forget" high-performance data transfers between systems within and across organizations.

There are many advantages to using Globus: 

- The Globus web app has an easy-to-use point-and-click interface.
- Transfers faster than SCP/SFTP (usually by a factor of two).
- Globus continues interrupted transfers – no need to restart.
- Globus allows you to schedule regular transfers.
- Get email notifications for successful or failed transfers.
- Globus accounts are free! Collaborators don’t need a sponsored UVA account to use Globus.
- VPN is not needed to transfer to and from UVA systems.
- Approved for transferring sensitive data (HIPAA, CUI).


### VPN or no VPN?

UVA Anywhere/More Secure VPN is not necessary for Globus. With just the web app, you can control transfers between systems that have Globus Personal Connect or Server installed.

* The VPN will slow down transfers between your computer and Rivanna.
* The High Security VPN completely blocks transfers between your computer and secure Ivy storage.
