* Because LLMs involve a huge number of computations, we need a form of parallelization to speed up the process.
  * Ex: ChatGPT free version (based on GPT-3.5): 175 billion parameters,
  * ChatGPT paid version (based on GPT-4): over 1 trillion parameters
* GPUs (graphics processing units) provide the needed parallelization and speed up.
* All the major deep learning Python libraries (Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras,â€¦) support the use of GPUs and allow users to distribute their code over multiple GPUs.
* New GPUs have been developed and optimized specifically for deep learning.
