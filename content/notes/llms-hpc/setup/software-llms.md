We will use Python deep learning libraries, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras, to run and fine-tune large language models (LLMs).
  
The [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) package is compatible with both PyTorch and TensorFlow. 

According to its documentation, "Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models." 

This package supports various applications, including Natural Language Processing (which is the focus of this workshop), Computer Vision, Audio, and Multimodal tasks.










Note: There are packages in R/Rstudio that can do deep learning and/or use LLMs.  We are not using those in this workshop.
