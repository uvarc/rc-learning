* We will use Python deep learning libraries to run and fine tune LLMs
  * PyTorch
  * TensorFlow/Keras
* The [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) package:
  * Works with PyTorch and TensorFlow
  * “Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models”
    * Natural Language Processing (our focus for today)
    * Computer Vision
    * Audio
    * Multimodal

- There are packages in R/Rstudio that can do deep learning and/or use LLMs.  We are not using those in this workshop
