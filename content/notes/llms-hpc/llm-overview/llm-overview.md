A Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep learning model that generally solves a natural language processing problem.
ChatGPT is an example of an LLM. 

There are many different types of LLMs that are suited to particular tasks.

Hubs such as [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) provide many LLMs for download.

You may hear people talk about LLMs for image classification, computer vision, etc.  These are also called VLMs (vision language models) and we are not covering those today.
