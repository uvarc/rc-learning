`$ hdquota` is the command for checking disk space.

`$ allocations` is the command to print active allocations and balances. For example, for live workshop demos, the `hpc_training` allocation will be available and removed after the workshop ends. 

It is also important to understand the difference between a login node and a compute node: the login node is where you connect, prepare files, and submit jobs, while the compute node is where the actual job execution takes place.
