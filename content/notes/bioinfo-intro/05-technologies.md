**Illumina**: Illumina tools generate short read sequences (< 1kb). They are widely used for whole-genome and exome sequencing, small RNA/microRNA profiling, and many single-cell applications.

**PacBio**: PacBio generates long read sequences (~ 25 kb). The PacBio Revio sequencer is available at UVA.

**Nanopore**: Nanopore generates "ultra-long" sequences (up to 1Mb). 

**HiC**: HiC is a crosslinking technique used to capture interactions within a genome.
