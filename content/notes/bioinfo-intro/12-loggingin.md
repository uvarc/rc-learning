`pwd` is the command to print your working directory. 

UVA RC working directories:

`$ /home/user_id` is your home directory, which contains up to 200GB of storage.

`$ /scratch/user_id` is your scratch directory, which contains up to 10TB storage. The scratch directory is "temporary" storage, meaning files not accessed within 90 days are deleted. You can check files for purging through Open On Demand utilities.
