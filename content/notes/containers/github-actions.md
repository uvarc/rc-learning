GitHub Actions allow us to incorporate **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment** in our repository. We can automatically rebuild and redeploy our app whenever any changes are committed to the repo.

To add a workflow to your repo:

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory.

2. Add the following .YAML file to the new directory, replacing the **IMAGE_NAME** and **SVC_NAME** with your image's name and the name that you want for your app on the Kubernetes cluster, respectively.

```
name: Container Build CICD

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - 'main'

env:
  # The preferred container registry
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  # The base org/image-name for the container
  IMAGE_NAME: uvarc/chickweight
  # A service name if mapping this to a k8s deployment
  SVC_NAME: chickWeight

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set ENV
        run: echo "IMAGE_TAG=${GITHUB_REF#refs/*/}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
