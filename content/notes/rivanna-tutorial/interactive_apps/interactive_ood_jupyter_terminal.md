You are also able to access the terminal through a JupyterLab session.

Here, you can execute linux commands to create custom conda environments and JupyterLab kernels. Additionally, you can access and run singularity containers through this functionality.

JupyterLab sessions will be saved in your ```/home/computingID/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/jupyter_lab/output/``` directory on Rivanna; however, you can navigate to any part of the filesystem in the JupyerLab terminal.
