Rstudio Server is a standalone app similar to JupyterLab. Starting a session is very similar to JupyterLab, but the Webform differs slightly.  Instead of kernel tiles, you will select a version of R from a dropdown menu from those available.  In this example, the version is R 4.2.2.

Rstudio Server can continuing running any active processes if your network is disconnected.  Simply log back in to Open OnDemand, go to the My Interactive Sessions tab, and click `Launch` again.  It will reconnect, not launch another session.
