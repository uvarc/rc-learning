Remember that Open OnDemand is a Web application.  If it freezes on you, click `UVA Open OnDemand` in the upper left.  It will log you out eventually so you may need to log in again.  You also may have to refresh pages to see changes.

It may also open many tabs.  It is safe to close them if you aren't using them; just make sure you first click "Save" for any files you are editing and want to save changes.  You can even close all the tabs and log in again.
