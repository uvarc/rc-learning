00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.920
Hello everyone and thank you for joining us for&nbsp;
this tutorial on the Globus File Transfer Service.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.720
We'll start at the Research&nbsp;
Computing learning portal.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.160
We will go through installing&nbsp;
a Globus personal connector,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.840
connecting to UVA data transfer nodes or DTNs,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.880
transferring files, and then&nbsp;
we'll go over some common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.240
errors that you might experience in using Globus.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.520
Globus is a non-profit service for fast,&nbsp;
secure, and reliable data transfer.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.440
It allows you to transfer files&nbsp;
between one computer to another,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.320
such as between your laptop or lab workstation and&nbsp;
our central computing resources, Rivanna or Ivy.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.520
Globus has several advantages, especially&nbsp;
for transferring large files or folders.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.160
It is fast, it is error correcting,&nbsp;
and it runs in the background.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.280
Using a VPN is not needed to&nbsp;
transfer to and from UVA systems.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.160
In fact, the high-security VPN cannot&nbsp;
be enabled when you are using Globus.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.720
Globus is approved for transferring sensitive&nbsp;
data to or from the UVA high-security zone

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.200
since our DTNs encrypt files in transit,&nbsp;
so PII and HIPAA data are protected.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.800
Now let's go over some basic Globus terminology.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.600
A collection refers to a computer&nbsp;
server or folder containing data.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.840
A collection can exist on&nbsp;
Rivanna or your personal machine.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.920
Your personal collection is a set&nbsp;
of folders on your local computer.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.400
Globus starts with a default set&nbsp;
of folders but you can add more.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.000
The personal connector is a software package&nbsp;
that you install to your local computer.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.720
It runs in the background and manages&nbsp;
transfers to and from that computer.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.920
UVA Standard Security Storage is&nbsp;
the collection for Rivanna storage&nbsp;

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.920
as well as Research Standard&nbsp;
and Research Project storage.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.800
UVA Ivy DTN is the collection&nbsp;
for Ivy central storage.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.680
A shared collection is a collection that&nbsp;
you can share with other Globus users.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.600
We'll start by installing the Globus&nbsp;
personal connector on a computer.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.760
In this example I will be&nbsp;
installing it on a Windows computer.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.760
First, I'll open this link and&nbsp;
download Globus Connect Personal.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.560
Be sure it's for your operating system.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.400
Once it is downloaded, install it in&nbsp;
the usual way for your operating system.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.840
You must provide a unique name&nbsp;
to your personal collection.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.960
Make it distinctive and&nbsp;
easy to find with a search.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.640
The name that I choose for my&nbsp;
collection is "eubanksdesktop".

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.760
Once the installation completes, you can add&nbsp;
more folders to your collection if you wish.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.760
Right click the Globus icon and select&nbsp;
Options. Under Access, click the plus icon.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.680
When the dialog box appears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.080
browse to the folder you want to make&nbsp;
accessible to Globus and click "Choose".

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.320
We are now ready to transfer files.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.800
We'll go to the Globus website.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.280
Click "Login" at the upper right.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.760
You should sign in under "Use your&nbsp;
existing organizational login".

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.120
Type "University of Virginia" as the organization.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.720
This will bring up a NetBadge login page.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.920
Once logged in, you'll be in the File Manager.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.320
In the collection text box, start typing&nbsp;
the name of your personal collection.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.000
For this example, I will be transferring files&nbsp;
to Rivanna, but the process is the same for Ivy.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.880
Once it appears, the icon on the left&nbsp;
should be green, showing that it's active.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.000
Here we see the contents of the default directory,&nbsp;
which is Documents for Windows and macOS.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.360
I can navigate to other folders starting&nbsp;
from the up arrow, up one folder icon.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.480
Suppose I want to transfer the JeffersonAI folder.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.800
First I must select a destination.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.160
Go to the collections text box&nbsp;
on the right and start typing.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.840
A search box will appear.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.400
For standard security storage,&nbsp;
choose UVA Standard Security Storage.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.040
The green icon on the left confirms it's active,&nbsp;

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.000
while the green columns icon on the right&nbsp;
indicates it's a managed collection.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.520
Choose that collection.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.400
You should be returned to the file manager page.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.240
The standard security folders to&nbsp;
which you have access will fill in.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.360
You may need to click through to your specific&nbsp;
folder in home, scratch, and so forth.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.760
I'll now select my JeffersonAI folder&nbsp;
in my personal collection pane,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.400
select a folder in my UVA storage if&nbsp;
I want it deeper than the top level,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.080
then click start with the arrow&nbsp;
pointing towards the destination.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.480
The transfer should begin automatically.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.080
Transfers to and from the Ivy DTN are done&nbsp;
the same way, but we would start by choosing

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.800
that DTN as the destination.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.840
You can share folders on the managed DTNs.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.440
Only managed DTNs can create shared collections.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.040
You cannot share folders from&nbsp;
your personal collection.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.480
Check the box by the folder&nbsp;
or file you wish to share.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.360
Click the share icon on the left of the pane.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.320
You will be asked to create a collection name.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.600
As usual, be sure it is unique and memorable.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.800
You can then invite people to join the collection.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.640
Now let's talk about some common&nbsp;
errors that we have with Globus.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.240
So if you have more questions, you&nbsp;
can simply go to this website and get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.480
a more in-depth answer to some of your&nbsp;
problems that you may be encountering.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.760
Health System users may find that there's a&nbsp;
firewall that prevents Globus from connecting.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.400
You'll need to ask HIT to complete&nbsp;
the connector installation for you.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.360
It's important to note as&nbsp;
well that Globus does not work&nbsp;

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.120
while connected to the UVA High Security VPN.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.400
Be sure to disconnect from the High&nbsp;
Security VPN before attempting a transfer.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.960
Another common error is that you may&nbsp;
find your transferred folders are empty.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.440
Most often this happens because you&nbsp;
have a file somewhere in that folder&nbsp;

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.040
with bad permissions or bad&nbsp;
characters in the file name.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.000
If you see this, when you start your transfer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.800
be sure to choose "Skip files&nbsp;
with errors" in the options.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.760
And then finally, if you can't connect&nbsp;
to UVA Standard Security Storage at all,

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.240
it might be because your&nbsp;
eServices account has expired.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.840
You can refer to the notes&nbsp;
at the RC Learning site.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.440
Globus also has a lot of&nbsp;
documentation at their site.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.320
Thank you for watching this&nbsp;
tutorial and we hope it was helpful.
